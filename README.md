# strikethrough
The person to strikethrough the bars loses

## Computer Strategy

The computer follows mis√®re Nim rules. When every row has at most one
unstruck bar, it attempts to leave an odd number of remaining bars by
removing one only if the total is even. If a single row contains more
than one bar, the computer will reduce that row so that the total number
of rows containing exactly one bar becomes odd. In all other cases it
falls back to normal Nim play by making the nim-sum zero.
